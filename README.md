# Project 2 - *MovieFlix*

**Movie Flix** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **13** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.

- [X] User can search for a movie.
- [X] All images fade in as they are loading.

- [X] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [X] Customize the selection effect of the cell.
- [X] Customize the navigation bar.
- [X] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Placeholder image while requesting from network.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. TableViews and CollectionViews
2. Adding a way to rate movies.ufijuheruhelthfjrbvctcgfuheibkij

## Notes

* At first, learning to use TableView and CollectionView is pretty hard. After this project, the process doesn't seem that complex anymore.
* I struggled a lot with small things like fading images and loading low-res -> high-res.
